# Installation

* Install ðŸ¤— Transformers for whichever deep learning library youâ€™re working with, setup your cache, and optionally configure ðŸ¤— Transformers to run offline.
* ðŸ¤— Transformers is tested on Python 3.6+, PyTorch 1.1.0+, TensorFlow 2.0+, and Flax. Follow the installation instructions below for the deep learning library you are using:

* [PyTorch installation instructions.](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
* [TensorFlow 2.0 installation instructions.](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip)
* Flax installation instructions.(https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Install with pip
* You should install ðŸ¤— Transformers in a virtual environment. 
* If youâ€™re unfamiliar with Python virtual environments, 
* [take a look at this guide.](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

* A virtual environment makes it easier to manage different projects, and avoid compatibility issues between dependencies.

* Next, Start by creating a virtual environment in your project directory:

""
* On Linux and MacOs:```python3 -m venv .venv```
* on Windows:```py -m venv .venv```

* Activate the virtual environment. On Linux and MacOs:
```source .env/bin/activate```

* Activate Virtual environment on Windows ```.venv/Scripts/activate```

* Now youâ€™re ready to install ðŸ¤— Transformers with the following command:
```pip install transformers```

* install pillow for import images

  ``` pip install pillow```

For CPU-support only, 
* you can conveniently install ðŸ¤— Transformers and a deep learning library in one line. 
For example,
* install ðŸ¤— Transformers and PyTorch with:
```pip install 'transformers[torch]'```

* ðŸ¤— Transformers and TensorFlow 2.0:
```pip install 'transformers[tf-cpu]'```
